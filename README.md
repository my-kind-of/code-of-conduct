# The Quick Version

Our events are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. 

We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for our venues, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from events without a refund at the discretion of the organisers.

# What we won't respond to
Our community priotizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:

* Reverse-isms, including reverse racism, reverse sexism, and cisphobia.
* Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone", "go away", or "I'm not discussing this with you"
* Refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts
* Communicating in a 'tone' you don't find congenial
* Criticising racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

# The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff immediately. Event staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.

All staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

**We expect all participants to follow these rules at all our event venues and event-related social activities.**
